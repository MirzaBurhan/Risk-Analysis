Business Problem Understanding
The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to people due to their inadequate or missing credit history. Some consumers use this to their advantage by becoming a defaulter. Let us consider your work for a consumer finance company that specialises in lending various types of loans to customers. You must use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to analyse the patterns present in the data which will make sure that the loans are not rejected for the applicants capable of repaying.

When the company receives a loan application, the company has to rights for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s or company’s decision:

If the aspirant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan tends in a business loss to the company.
If the a is aspirant not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default/fraud, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.
The data contains information about the loan application.

When a client applies for a loan, there are four types of decisions that could be taken by the bank/company:
Approved
Cancelled
Refused
Unused offer: The loan has been cancelled by the applicant but at different stages of the process.
In this case study, you will use Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes impact the tendency of default.

Business Goal
This case study aims to identify patterns that indicate if an applicant will repay their instalments which may be used for taking further actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending at a higher interest rate, etc. This will make sure that the applicants capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Recognition of such aspirants using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques is the main focus of this case study.
